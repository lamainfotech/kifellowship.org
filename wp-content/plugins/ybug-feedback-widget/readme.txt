Collect visual feedback and bug reports with screenshots from your users. This plugin allows you to easily add Ybug Feedback Widget on your website.

== Description ==

**Collect visual feedback on your website**
Ybug is a visual feedback and bug tracking tool for websites.
Install our Feedback Widget plugin on your WordPress website and start collecting visual feedback, suggestions and bug reports from your team, your clients or website visitors. Ybug will automatically attach screenshot and some important information about the browser environment and console log.

**Integrate with tools you already use**
Do you already use another bug tracking tool? No problem, feedback reports can easily be forwarded to 20+ integrations including project management tools (such as Asana, Trello, Jira, Wrike, Teamwork Projects, YouTrack, ClickUp), customer support systems (Zendesk, Freshdesk) or software development platforms (such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket).
You can also get notified about any new feedback (created with Ybug) to your email, Slack or Twist channels of your choice. Any other 3rd party service can be added with our Zapier or Webhook integration.

**Easy widget customization**
The Feedback Widget can be easily customised, you can change the launcher position, language, feedback form inputs and also widget colors to meet your brand styles.
Ybug's widget code is asynchronous and is designed not to slow down your site. The launcher button takes only one small request to load.
